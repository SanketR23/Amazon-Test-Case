Amazon Test Case

A simple test case for Amazon could involve the functionality of adding a product to the shopping cart. The test case would verify that when a user clicks the "Add to Cart" button for a specific product, the product is successfully added to the cart and the cart total is updated accordingly. The test would also ensure that the correct product details, such as name, price, and quantity, are displayed in the cart. Additionally, the test case would confirm that the user can proceed to checkout from the cart page.
